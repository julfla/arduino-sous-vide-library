arduino-sous-vide-cooker
========================

This project aims at creating a library to control the temperature of a rice cooker.
Do so, we could use it as a low temperature, sous-vide cooker.
It is largely inspired from the Adafruit, SousViduino project but wants to have a better separation between the model and the HMI.
